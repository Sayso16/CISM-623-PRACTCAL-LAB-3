Includes word frequency analysis and explores core NLP concepts by processing classic literature text. Skills:Python NLTK Text Preprocessing,Tokenization,Bag-of-Words

##Practical Lab 3: Text Analysis & NLP with NLTK
**Project Overview**
This project is the third practical lab for the CISM 623: Machine Learning course. It serves as an introduction to fundamental Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts by performing a detailed analysis of Lewis Carroll's classic novel, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".

The lab focuses on preprocessing raw text data and extracting meaningful insights using the powerful nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) library in Python. The core tasks involve tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization, and frequency analysis to understand the structure and content of the text.

**Learning Objectives**
* By completing this assignment, you will gain practical experience in:

* Text Preprocessing: Converting raw text into a clean, analyzable format by handling case normalization, punctuation removal, and tokenization.

* Natural Language Processing (NLP): Applying key NLP techniques including:

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.

Stopword Removal: Filtering out common but insignificant words (e.g., "the", "and", "is").

Stemming & Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form to normalize the text.

Frequency Analysis: Building and analyzing a Bag-of-Words model to identify the most common terms and their distribution within the text.

Data Manipulation: Working extensively with Python data structures like lists, dictionaries, and strings to process and analyze textual data.

**Technical Skills Demonstrated**
Programming Language: Python

Key Libraries:

nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) for all core NLP operations.

string for basic string manipulation and punctuation handling.

NLP Techniques:

Tokenization with TreebankWordTokenizer

Stopword identification and removal using nltk.corpus.stopwords

Stemming using SnowballStemmer

Lemmatization using WordNetLemmatizer

Building a Bag-of-Words model for word frequency counting.
